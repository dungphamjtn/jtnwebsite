== Description ==

 	

NextGEN Gallery another plugin for WordPress by Alex Rabe was the inspiration for this small and
simple plugin. I really must say he did and still does a great job with this plugin but sometimes
such a huge plugin is simply too much. So I decided to develop a small plugin with less
configuration settings and no extra tables for the WordPress Database. Simplicity should be the
guide for the advanture of developing this plugin. As far as I can say I did the job well and it
is just a Slideshow to set your images in the right context. Nothing more nothing less.
