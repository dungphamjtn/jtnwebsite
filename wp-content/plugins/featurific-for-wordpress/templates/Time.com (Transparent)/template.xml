	<!-- IMPORTANT NOTES:

		* When upgrading the Featurific for Wordpress plugin, changes to your templates **will be overwritten**.  To avoid
			losing your changes, save your modified templates before upgrading the plugin.  Then, upgrade the plugin, and
			finally, restore your modified templates.

		* Featurific for Wordpress generates the data*.xml file every x minutes (e.g. 10 minutes by default).  The next time
			the data*.xml file is generated, your changes to this template will be visible.  However, if you wish to see your
			changes more immediately, access the Featurific Settings page (Settings->Featurific), and hit the "Update Options"
			button at the bottom without changing any of your settings.  Doing so forces a regeneration of the data*.xml file,
			so you can see the result of your modifications immediately.

		A no-frills gallery, similar to that of Time.com.  It uses the first picture found in each post (or default.jpg if no image is found) as the main image for each screen.  To change the default image, simply replace default.jpg with the desired image.  To resize the width of the gallery, open Time.com/template.xml and replace each instance of 'width="350"' with 'width="xxx"'.  Resizing the height is done likewise, but requires a bit of addition/subtraction.  [a href='http://featurific.com']Designed by Rich Christiansen[/a].  Time is a registered trademark of Time Inc.
